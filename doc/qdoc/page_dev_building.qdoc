\title Building Live CV


All modules for Live CV are available through qmake projects. To compile Live CV you need to have Qt 5.6 or higher, and
Open CV 3.1 or higher. On windows, OPENCV_DIR
\l{http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html}{environment variable}
needs to be set, or you can configure the
variable whithin the source code of Live CV in \e{projects/3rdparty/opencv.pri} before compiling.

You can build the application either by opening \e{livecv.pro} in QtCreator and building from there, or by manually
running qmake in your build directory:

\code
cd build
qmake -r ..
make (or nmake)
\endcode

\section1 Modules

Live CV is split into 3 main modules:

\list
\li \b{The application}, containing the visual elements and the runtime types
\li \b{The editor}, containing components for projects and editing
\li \b{The plugins}, containing the plugins you can import, some of which can also be linked to as libraries in ordeer
to provide common transferable types.
\endlist

Further down, the editor contains the \l{lcveditor_cpp}{lcveditor} module, which you can link to in order to
provide editor functionality to Live CV(e.g. palettes, code completion, highlighting for different file types)

The plugins module then contains the \l{live}{live} library, which offers components for live coding
and communication with Live CVs interface, and lcvcore library which offers computer vision specific main types (mostly
named after Open CV). You link to them as libraries in order to create Live CV specific plugins.

It's also important to note that Live CV as an application is mostly plugin based, so we can for example disable all
Open CV based plugins from our build configuration, and build Live CV outside of Open CV dependencies. All QtQuick based
plugins are compatible by default, and you can build any plugins derived from those without having to link to any Live CV
libraries.
